## Perform a regression

We start by

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

model <- lm(
  bill_length_mm ~ bill_depth_mm + flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g + sex,
  data = penguins,
  na.action = na.omit
)

```



## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
